1. A computer program is said to learn from experience E with

          respect to some task T and some performance measure P if its

          performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

          Suppose we feed a learning algorithm a lot of historical weather

          data, and have it learn to predict weather. In this setting, what is T?
          
Answer: The weather prediction task.

2. Suppose you are working on weather prediction, and your weather

          station makes one of three predictions for each day's weather:

          Sunny, Cloudy or Rainy.  You'd like to use a learning algorithm

          to predict tomorrow's weather.

          Would you treat this as a classification or a regression problem?
Answer: Classification
3. Suppose you are working on stock market prediction,  Typically

          tens of millions of shares of Microsoft stock are traded

          (i.e., bought/sold) each day.  You would like to predict the

          number of Microsoft shares that will be traded tomorrow.

          Would you treat this as a classification or a regression problem?
Answer: Regression
4. Some of the problems below are best addressed using a supervised learning algorithm, 
and the others with an unsupervised learning algorithm. Which of the following would you
apply supervised learning to? (Select all that apply.) In each case, assume some appropriate
dataset is available for your algorithm to learn from.
Answer: 1) Given genetic data from a person, predict the odds of him/her developing diabetes over the next 10 years 2) Examine the statistics of two 
football teams and predict which team will win tomorrows match (given historical data).
5. Which of these is a reasonable definition of machine learning?
Answer: Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicity programmed.
