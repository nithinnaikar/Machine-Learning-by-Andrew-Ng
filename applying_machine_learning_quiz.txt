1. The algorithm is suffering from high variance.
2. 1) Try using a smaller set of features 2) Try increasing the regularization paramter lambda
3. 1) Try adding polynomial features 2) Try to obtain and use additional features
4. 1) A typical split of a dataset into training, validation, and testing sets might be in a 60:20:20 ratio respectively. 2) Suppose you are using linear regression to 
predict housing prices and your dataset comes sorted in increasing sizes of house. It is therefore important to randomly shuffle the dataset before splitting to ensure a fair 
distribution for each of the subsets. 
5. 1) If a learning algorithm is suffering from high variance, adding more training examples is likely to improve the test set error 2) If a learning algorithm is suffering from 
high bias, only adding more training examples may not improve the test error significantly 3) A model with more parameters is more prone to overfitting and typically has higher
variance.
