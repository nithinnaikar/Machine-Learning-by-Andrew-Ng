1. 1) In a computer chip fabrication plant, identify microchips that might be defective. 2) From a large set of primary care patient records, identify individuals who might
have unusual health conditions.
2. You need to increase epsilon.
3. You should create an additional feature x3 = x1 / x2.
4. 1) When choosing features for an anomaly detection system, it is a good idea to look for features that take on unusually small or large values for (mainly) the anomalous 
examples. 2) If you do not have any labeled data (or if all your data has label y = 0), then it is still possible to learn p(x), but it may be harder to evaluate the system
or choose a good value of epsilon.
5. The Gaussian distribution will (approximately) have parameters mew_1 (mean) = -3 and sigma^2 (variance) = 2^2 = 4
