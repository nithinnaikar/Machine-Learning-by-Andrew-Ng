1. standardized feature (z-scored) = 0.52
2. alpha = 0.3 is an effective choice of learning rate
3. X is a 23x6 matrix, y is a 23x1 vector, and theta is a 6x1 vector
4. Gradient descent, since the inverse of the matrix will be very slow to compute in the Normal equation.
5. It speeds up gradient descent by making it run fewer iterations to get to a good solution.
