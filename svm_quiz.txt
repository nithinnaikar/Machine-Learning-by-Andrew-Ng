1. It would be reasonable to try decreasing C parameter. It would also be reasonable to try increasing sigma^2 parameter.
2. Figure 4 shows the Gaussian kernel at sigma^2 = 0.25
3. The cost term will equal 0 iff 1) For every example in which y_i = 0, we have that theta_transpose * x_i <= -1 and 2) For every example in which y_i = 1, we have that
theta_tranpose * x >= 1
4. Promising steps are 1) Create / add new polynomial features and 2) Try using an SVM with Gaussian kernel.
5. 1) Suppose you have 2D input examples. The decision boundary of the SVM (with the linear kernel) is a straight line 2) The maximum value of the Gaussian kernel (i.e
similarity(x, landmark)) is 1.
